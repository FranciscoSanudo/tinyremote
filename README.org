* Description
A minimal project to run a lightweight remote desktop environment (i3 + VNC) inside a Docker container. Designed as a tiny, reproducible reference for personal use or as a starter template.

* Goals
- Provide a minimal, easy-to-use configuration.
- Keep everything reproducible using Docker / Docker Compose.
- Play well with Emacs (org-mode and Doom Emacs configuration included).

* Requirements
- Docker and docker-compose (or Podman + podman-compose)
- GNU Make (optional)
- Emacs/Doom Emacs if you plan to use the included editor configuration

* Getting started
1. Build and start the project with Docker Compose:
   #+begin_src sh
   docker-compose up -d --build
   #+end_src

2. Connect via VNC at: localhost:5901 (default)

3. Useful environment variables (export before running if needed):
   - BASE_URL: base URL for services (if applicable)
   - INTERVAL: monitoring interval in seconds
   - ENDPOINTS_FILE, LOG_FILE: paths used by the monitor

* Repository structure
- Dockerfile :: base image and script installation
- docker-compose.yml :: service definition for i3wm
- scripts/ :: startup and installation scripts
- config/ :: i3, emacs, fish and other configs

* Recommended next steps
- Add CI for build and smoke tests (there is a basic workflow in .github/workflows)
- Add a .env.example documenting configuration variables
- Review VNC security before exposing the service in production
